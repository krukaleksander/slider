Slider
=======

Sliders like this one are mostly used when you want to show client a difference between the old state and new state. For example: before taking magic fat burning pills (lose ten kilos in one week, eat whatever you want) and after.

## About code

* In this project I could used class, but I decided to take more functional approach;
* There was a problem with pictures in slider after resizing the window. I made adjustImagesSize function to fix it.  It gets image container width and give it to the images;
* It works not only on desktop but also on mobile - touchstart, touchend, touchmove events.
